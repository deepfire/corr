* What
  [[https://travis-ci.org/deepfire/corr/][https://api.travis-ci.org/deepfire/corr.svg?branch=master]]

  /corr/ is an interactive console application that ties a Youtrack instance and a
  Git repository, to provide certain functionality in its =corr ui= mode:

    - correlate Git branches and YouTrack issues
    - interactively & incrementally query issues and observe their comments
    - post issue comments

  A separate mode, called =corr exec= allows to execute Youtrack commands.

  Still separate is a =ghci= integration, allowing interactive exploration of
  Youtrack objects.

* Installation, using Nix

  1. Install Nix:

      bash <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)

     If security implications of this particular step worry you, please read the
     following piece by Domen KoÅ¾ar:
     https://www.domenkozar.com/2015/09/27/friends-sometimes-let-friends-curl-to-shell/)

  2. Obtain & build corr:

     : git clone https://github.com/deepfire/corr
     : cd corr
     : nix-env --no-build-output --cores 4 -iE 'f: (import ./. {})'

  3. Validate:

     : corr --help

* Setup

  1. Secure connection (none other is provided) requires SSL certificate of the
     Youtrack server (=someserver.crt=).

  2. A secret corresponding to the server/user name pair must be provided by the
     means of =~/.authinfo= (yes, it's far from ideal):

    : machine youtrack.server.hostname login username password password

* Usage

  =corr= *connection parameters* can be specified either via its command line, or
  by =~/.corrc=, which is updated after first successful connection.

  Mandatory *connection parameters*:

    - =--server=      :: YouTrack server hostname
    - =--rest-prefix= :: REST-service prefix (typically "/rest")
    - =--login=       :: user name
    - =--cacert=      :: server SSL certificate (=someserver.crt=)
    - =--project=     :: YouTrack project alias
